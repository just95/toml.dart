# **Flutter** example

This example demonstrates how to load and parse a TOML asset and display `Hello, World!` in a `Text` widget.

## Requirements

You need to have installed the [Flutter SDK][flutter-sdk].

## Running on a device

Connect your device or start your emulator and see that it's connected using:

```
flutter devices
```

All of the following commands have to be executed in the root directory of this example.

```bash
cd ./example/flutter_example
```

Before you can run the example, first download the required dependencies.

```bash
flutter pub get
```

Now you can run the example as follows.

```bash
flutter run
```

Or given a device name from `flutter devices`.

```bash
flutter run -d <device-name>
```
