This package provides an implementation of a TOML (Tom's Obvious, Minimal Language) parser and encoder for Dart.

It currently supports version [0.4.0][toml-spec/v0.4.0] of the TOML specification.

## Installation

To get started add `toml` as a dependency to your `pubspec.yaml` and run the
`dart pub get` or `flutter pub get` command.

```yaml
dependencies:
  toml: "^0.6.1"
```

## Usage

The `toml.dart` package includes three libraries for loading, decoding and encoding TOML documents.
The usage of the individual libraries is described in the subsequent sections in more detail.
Additional examples for the usage of the `toml.dart` package can be found in the [`./example`][toml-dart/example] directory.

All three libraries `toml.decoder`, `toml.encoder` and `toml.loader` are reexported by the `toml` library.
Thus, a single import usually suffices.

```dart
import 'package:toml/toml.dart';
```

### Load Configuration Files

Before any configuration file can be parsed, the library needs to know how to load it.
There are two default methods available, but you can easily implement your own loading mechanism as described in the next section.

If your code is running in the **browser**, you probably want to use XHR to
fetch the file from the server.
To do so import the `toml.loader.http` library and call the static `HttpConfigLoader.use` method, e.g., from your `main` function.

```dart
import 'package:toml/loader/http.dart';

void main() {
  HttpConfigLoader.use();
  // ...
}
```

An example for loading a configuration file via HTTP can be found in [`./example/http_config_loader`][toml-dart/example/http_config_loader].

If your code is running in the **Dart VM**, you can load configuration files from the local file system.
Simply import the `toml.loader.fs` library and call the static `FilesystemConfigLoader.use` method, e.g., from your `main` function.

```dart
import 'package:toml/loader/fs.dart';

void main() {
  FilesystemConfigLoader.use();
  // ...
}
```

An example for loading a configuration file from a file can be found in [`./example/filesystem_config_loader`][toml-dart/example/filesystem_config_loader].

For convenience both libraries export the `loadConfig` function from the `toml.loader` library.
It optionally takes the path to the configuration file as its only argument (defaults to `'config.toml'`) and returns a `Future` of the parsed configuration options.

```dart
Future main() async {
  // ...
  var cfg = await loadConfig();
  // ...
}
```

### Implement a Custom Loader

To create a custom loader which fits exactly your needs import the `toml.loader` library, create a new class and implement the `ConfigLoader` interface.
You can use the following template as a starting point.

```dart
library my.config.loader;

import 'package:toml/loader.dart';
export 'package:toml/loader.dart' show loadConfig;

class MyConfigLoader implements ConfigLoader {

  static void use() {
    ConfigLoader.use(new MyConfigLoader());
  }

  @override
  Future<String> loadConfig(String filename) {
    // ...
  }

}
```

In your `main` function invoke the `MyConfigLoader.use` method and call the `loadConfig` function as usual.

An example for writing a custom configuration file loader can be found in [`./example/custom_config_loader`][toml-dart/example/custom_config_loader].

### Decode TOML

When you are using the `toml.loader` library, you don't have to decode TOML documents manually.
The decoding is performed by `loadConfig` already.
However, if you have a `String` and want to decode its contents as a TOML document, you can use the `toml.decoder` library.

```dart
import 'package:toml/decoder.dart';
```

This library contains the actual `TomlParser` class whose `parse` method takes a `String` and returns a `Result` object.
The result's `value` property holds an unmodifiable `Map` of the parsed document.

```dart
var toml = '''
  # ...
''';
var parser = new TomlParser();
var document = parser.parse(toml).value;
```

An example for using `TomlParser` to decode a string can be found in [`./example/toml_parser`][toml-dart/example/toml_parser].

### Encode TOML

This package includes a TOML encoder.
To use it add the following import.

```dart
import 'package:toml/encoder.dart';
```

The library provides a `TomlEncoder` class whose `encode` method takes a `Map` and returns a TOML encoded `String`.
All values of the map must be natively representable by TOML or implement the `TomlEncodable` interface.

```dart
var document = {
  // ...
};
var encoder = new TomlEncoder();
var toml = encoder.encode(document);
```

Classes which implement the `TomlEncodable` interface define a `toToml` method whose return value can be represented by TOML in turn.

An example for using the `TomlEncoder` and the `TomlEncodable` interface to encode a `Map` can be found in [`./example/toml_encoder`][toml-dart/example/toml_encoder].

## Data Structure

TOML **documents** and **tables** as well as **inline tables** are represented through nested `UnmodifiableMapView` objects whose keys are `String`s and values `dynamic` read-only representations of the corresponding TOML value or sub-table.
The contents of a table declared by

```toml
[a.b.c]
key = 'value'
```

may be accessed using `[]` as shown in the listing below.

```dart
var table = document['a']['b']['c']; // ok
var value = table['key'];
```

The following, however, is invalid.

```dart
var table = document['a.b.c']; // error
table['key'] = value; // error
```

All kinds of **arrays** including **arrays of tables** are stored as `UnmodifiableListView` objects.
Though the encoder accepts any `Iterable`.
The items of the list represent either a value or a table.
Consider the document that contains an array of tables.

```toml
[[items]]
name = 'A'

[[items]]
name = 'B'

[[items]]
name = 'C'
```

It is possible to iterate over the tables in the array.

```dart
document['items'].forEach((Map item) { // ok
  print(item.name);
});
```

However, it is not allowed to add, remove or modify its entries.

```dart
document['items'].add({ // error
  'name': 'D'
});
document['items'][0] = { // error
  'name': 'E'
};
```

All **string** variants produce regular dart `String`s.
All of the following are therefore equivalent.

```toml
str1 = "Hello World!"
str2 = 'Hello World!'
str3 = """
  Hello \
  World!\
"""
str4 = '''Hello World!'''
```

**Integers** are of type `int` and **float**ing point numbers are represented as `double`s.
When compiled to JavaScript these two types are not distinct.
Thus a float without decimal places might accidentally be encoded as an integer.
This behavior would lead to the generation of invalid numeric arrays.
The `TomlEncoder` addresses this issue by analyzing the contents of numeric arrays first.
If any of its items cannot be represented as an integer, all items will be encoded as floats instead.
Encoding the following map, for example, would throw an `MixedArrayTypesException` in the VM.

```dart
var document = {
  'array': [1, 2.0, 3.141]
};
```

However, in JavaScript, the encoder yields the following TOML document.

```toml
array = [1.0, 2.0, 3.141]
```

**Boolean** values are obviously of type `bool`.

**Datetime** values are UTC `DateTime` objects.

## Testing

To see whether everything is working correctly change into the root directory of this package and run the included tests as follows:

```sh
dart test
```

You may pass the `--platform` command line argument to test the package on other platforms than the VM.
Run `dart test --help` for a list of all available platforms.

Alternatively, you can run [`toml-test`][toml-test] (again from the package root):

```sh
$GOPATH/bin/toml-test bin/decoder.dart
$GOPATH/bin/toml-test -encoder bin/encoder.dart
```

Unfortunately, some tests from `toml-test` are failing at the moment.
Thus, `toml.dart` is not fully TOML [0.4.0][toml-spec/v0.4.0] compliant at the moment.
We will fix the failing tests in an upcoming release of this library soon.
